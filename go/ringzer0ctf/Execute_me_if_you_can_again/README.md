# Execute me if you can again

[Challenge 125](https://ringzer0ctf.com/challenges/125)

The same as Challenge 121, but you need to fix jump addresses that are passed to 2 instructions.
The first instruction at address "00" should jumt to address "52" instead of "4F".
The call instruction at address "52" should call address "02" instead of "05".
