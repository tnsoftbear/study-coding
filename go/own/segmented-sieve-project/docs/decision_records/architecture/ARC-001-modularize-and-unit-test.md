# ARC-001: Modularize and Unit Test

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current code base is not covered by unit tests and may be not decoupled properly to be easy covered by unit tests.

## Decisions

Research and implement a way to decouple the code base and cover it with unit tests.

## Consequences

This will improve testability and maintainability in long run.
