This repository contains different sources written by me as result of studing different programming languages and coding practices.

## Ansible

* [Bern project](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/ansible/bern/) Initial setup for the Debian 12 VM and MariaDB installation.

## Bash

Currently includes solutions for tasks of exercism.com case studies and my own experiments.

## Go

Currently includes solutions for tasks of exercism.com, codewars.com, spoj.com, ringzer0ctf.com case studies and my own experiments.  
For instance,

* [OOP implementation of prime numbers detection](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/go/own/segmented-sieve-project)
* Optimized [generator of prime numbers](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/go/spoj.com/IsPrime%20Print%20Optimized) is bases on the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm

## JavaScript

* [Javascript-Ninja](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/javascript/javascript-ninja) are solutions for tasks that were made in the course "Node advanced" in Summer of 2019.
* [SameSite](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/javascript/own/cookie/samesite) experiments with SameSite cookie property. May 2021.

## ReactJs

* [My experiments with react js](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/reactjs/own/tic-tak-toe-tutorial). It consists code written in JS and TS as well.

## Rust

Currently includes few solutions for tasks of exercism.com case studies.

## Scala

Nothing interesting.

## Terraform

* [Cairo project](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/terraform/cairo). This Terraform configuration is aimed at automating the creation and management of a virtual machine environment using the libvirt provider with QEMU on a Linux system. The objective is to deploy a fully operational VM with customizable networking, storage, and initialization settings, utilizing cloud-init for provisioning.
* [Canberra project](https://github.com/tnsoftbear/study-coding/tree/master/terraform/canberra). This project focuses on setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Kubespray and Ansible, deployed on virtual machines provisioned and managed through Terraform.

## TypeScript

Currently includes few solutions for tasks of exercism.com case studies
